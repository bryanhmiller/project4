	<p class="hidden" id="play-by-play">Lauren convinced Callan that they should work as a team to eliminate Zoe, and then proceeded to use Callan as a shield.  After landing a few drop kicks, Zoe forced Callan to tap out with an arm bar.  Lauren then offered Zoe a pie break, which she accepted.  She then served Zoe chess pie; however, her pie was actually a look-a-like cheese quiche.  On a fresh supply of protein, and Zoe weary from drop kicks and near a sugar coma, Lauren put Zoe in a sleeper hold until she passed out, winning the cage match.</p>
